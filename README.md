# University Management System with Sparse Table

This project is a **University Management System** implemented in Java.  
It allows you to manage students, courses, and enrollments efficiently, while keeping the system **modular** and easy to maintain.  

Key features include:  
- Adding and removing students and courses  
- Enrolling students in courses with capacity checks  
- Undo and redo operations for enrollment changes using a history stack  
- Sorting and listing students by courses, and courses by students  
- Efficient queries for enrollment data using a **Sparse Table-inspired structure**  

> ⚠️ Note: The repository includes a `Main` class with test code for demonstration purposes.  
> You can run it to see how the system works, but you can separate your own main application logic if needed.  

This system is designed to be modular, making it easy to extend and adapt for larger university management projects.
